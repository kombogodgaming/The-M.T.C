  <h1>Letter to Public Department<h1>
  <p>7/5/2019</p>
<p>Dear Public Health Official,</p>
	
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a very serious public health issue. It can cause coughing that lasts up to 3 weeks or longer, chest pain and coughing up blood. TB can cause spinal damage (paralysis), brain damage, and it can mess up the kidneys. If you have HIV, the chances of contracting Tuberculosis rise tremendously. Without treatment, Tuberculosis is also fatal. It is one of the leading causes of death in the entire world.</p>
 <p>Some ways we can help people avoid TB is by giving them a vaccine, washing hands often and etc. Tuberculosis is airborne so you also have to watch where you reside. One way to treat tuberculosis is by taking antibiotics. You would usually take the antibiotics for six to nine months, some times more if it is severe. The disease is so common worldwide, that over 2.5 billion people wither have tuberculosis mycobacterium whether active or inactive, meaning that about 1 in 3 people have tuberculosis. One of the main reasons, tuberculosis may become active within our respiratory system is due to the Human-Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV.  HIV is an STD whereupon contraction, the virus virtually destroys the immune system, usually leading to the disease known as AIDS, however, when the body already maintains inactive pathogens within the lungs, HIV may activate the pathogens, leading to an active contraction. To prevent anomalies like this from occurring, people need to properly protect themselves from the disease, through abstinence, and safer sex.</p> 
<p>Even Though, that people who contract HIV while maintaining inactive pathogens, may very well contract an active infection, a study of counties surrounding the Georgia area, statistics show that in our specific district, and many other counties surrounding us (Dekalb, Fulton, Clayton, Cobb), that foreign immigrants are the #1 infections of tuberculosis across each county (Dekalb, in particular, sustains foreigners as up to 66% of all incumbents). What this means, that many concentrations of tuberculosis span from foreign immigrants, and that we as a country have to prioritize the treatment of foreign individuals, instead of setting them aside. Especially with the increase of immigration from Asia and Africa the two leading TB contractions, continentally speaking. Also, there are communities in our districts that need better attending to. Communities of color, are very lacking in economic sustainability and are less likely to provide for themselves. As a public health department, it is your responsibility to apply for the needs of everyone, so I recommend taking that into consideration.</p>
<p>To conclude my thoughts, Tuberculosis is a serious infectious disease, that is a danger to the entire state. It transfers airborne and is commonly spread through HIV and foreign immigration. To protect ourselves we need to better spread awareness and protect individuals from the disease that are most vulnerable. With all this and more, I am confident that our district and others can eliminate the disease as an issue, making the world a safer, healthier place.</p>
