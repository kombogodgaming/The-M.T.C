			<p id="p1">My name is Brandon Lawrence. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia and raised in Stone Mountain, Georgia. I am a first-year scholar in the Smash Program> I am a rising sophomore at Tucker HIgh School. I live at home with a single mother. My mom means the world to me. I do not know what I would do if she wasn't here to take care of me. I am grateful to have her in my life even throughout all times we argued I am an only child on my mom's side. I have two step-brothers on my dad side.</p>
			
			<p id="p2">At Tucker High School I am apart of the Tucker Ambush of Sound, which is our marching band. I play the trumpet in the band. We call ourselves the Royal Trumpet Mafia(R.T.M.). I also play the flugelhorn separately from the band. Outside of school, I partake in Boy Scouts. I am a Star Scout on my way to becoming a Life Scout on my way to becoming a Life Scout and eventually become an Eagle Scout. In my free time, I like to play video games or hang out with my friends. Some of my favorite games to play are NBA2K, Kingdom Hearts, and Naruto Storm 4. I love to travel with my mom. Some places I have been to are New York, Jamaica, and Florida.</p>
