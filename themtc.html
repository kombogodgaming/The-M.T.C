<h1 id="heading">The M.T.C: Breakdown</h1>
<div id="blacks">
<div id="boxing">
<p>The M.T.C also known as the Mobile Tuberculosis/Testing Center is a non-profit organization designed to reach out to communities and individuals who are at risk of obtaining severe infectious diseases, by providing tesing, medecines, procedures, and health care for absolutely no cost, and one of it's main ways of conducting that is through our personally-engineered ambulence and van model. The model is designed to fit as a moving ambulence that has a balanced, stertile frame, with rollling effiency to prevent turbulence, which is perfect for doing TB or HIV tests on the fly. Also, there are more stiff, and acryllic models, designed as somewhat of a "ice-cream truck, but for TB tests, and treatments. Each model is labled as either a testing van(meant, for conducting diagnostic tests), or a treatment van (meant to conduct medicinal injections, and medical treatment for an active disease). As previously stated, this is available for anyone who calls, but we will personally advocate for less developed communities, and individuals of a lower income. Moving back to the veichles, they are electrically fueled, and are landmarked in certain areas of the state (particularly in less economical local areas), through our M.T.C garages, which hold relatively a dozen per garage.</p>
<p>The M.T.C provides every service absouluetly free, and our organization achieves this impossible dream through millions of dollars in donations and partnerships, with dozens medical companies, car franchises, auto-part franchises, along with collected charity funds, all of which combine to build the 75+ million dollar starting budget, which covers: the costs of cars, auto-part appliances, electrical subscriptions, mediacl equipment, financial aid program funds, emergency funds, garage, and headquarters construction funds, and payrolls to hire willing doctors, and drivers. </p>
<h2 id="questions">Potential Questions</h2>
<ol>
	<li>What is the contact and arrival process?</li>
	<p>By calling our testing number (404-818-TBTIME) you will be asked, your address, so that we contact the closest garage facility to send a van (we are flexible to those that may be considered homeless). Once the testing process is complete (you enter the van, and take the test), you will be acquited to our free treatment program, and/or our free M.T.C in-van procedure, which will usually be scheduled two-three days later (depending on time-overlap).</p>
	<li>How do I apply for the Free Treatment?</li>
	<p>The application process is within the section labled "Treatment Sign-Up", in the navbar above. You may also sign in utilizing our M.T.C app.</p>
	<li>App? What App?</li>
	<p>Our organization has imbedded designer tablets into our custom ambulances, with our private app known as "M.T.C Mobile". The app is not available for personal download, but while using the app in our ambulances, you are able to sign up for treatment, if your results come up postive. Also, you are granted access to a brochure of infographics, and exclamatory pages on Tuberculosis, any additional facts you could possibly ask for and more, are within this application.</p>
	<li>What about the homeless?</li>
	<p>Our program has built our garages, at a walking distance to some core homeless shelters. So far we've targeted areas under the "Atlanta Mission" such as, "The Sheperd's Inn" and "My Sister's House", and plan to extend futher along the lines of the metro-atlanta area.For the homeless, no application or calling process is required for testing, or treatment (they would have to merely confirm their stay at any nearby shelter, and would immedieately be tested). In our organization, homeless individuals, and foreigners are a top priority in the testing process.Everyone is of equal oppurtunity.</p>
	<li>How do you get Donations?</li>
	<p>Our program pitches our vision and idea to potential donars through commercial advertisings, and a proffessional pitching process.Check out our commerical through the link below.</p>
