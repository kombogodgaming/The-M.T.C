  <p class="goldy"> As the M.T.C, we as an Organization are responsible for having the most credible resources, and most applicable research for whatever issue in terms of infectious diseases we plan to solve as a group. With that being said, our main focus as an organization, is the infectious disease known as tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease, that's spans from air-to-air contact, contracted with in our body’s respiratory system, specifically our lungs. This disease is very dangerous, and a main focus for our organization, solely because of the danger and the fact that it's applicable to the state and area we live in. In this web page, you will be provided with all of the information on tuberculosis to the explicitly Last Detail, inferring and basing all of the information from collected resources,most notably from the CDC.</p>

 <p class="goldy">As previously stated, tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease. But the bacterium that bases itself with tuberculosis is the cumulus pathogen known as tuberculosis mycobacterium  which is so unbelievably common, that worldwide, one in three people have the pathogens within their bodies. One of the main differences between people who have contracted tuberculosis, and people who merely had the bacteria's within their bodies, can be classified into positions of active or inactive state. An inactive diagnosis only means that the bacteria resides within the body. This means that your immune system has the strength and physical capability to fight off the pathogens within your body, this prevents you from getting sick, it prevents the tuberculosis from activating, and therefore it prevents you from passing the bacterial disease to others. Active tuberculosis is essentially when the pathogens within your body, are able to defeat your immune system and spread to the lungs, and all other parts of the body to cause physical harm.</p>

 <p class="goldy">For the most part, most activated cases contain symptoms that submerge themselves within the lungs and attack the respiratory systems. These attacks, can lead to the coughing of blood, sweating, congestion, diarrhea, loss of breath, and a few other respiratory symptoms due to a lack of a proper breathing ability. However, what makes active tuberculosis so dangerous and even fatal, is the bacteria's ability to pass on the disease to other parts of the body and affect those directly. This fact leads to an anomaly, and plethora of individualized systems depending on the systems in the body that are attacked by the pathogen. Tuberculosis in the mind, can cause neck stiffness, nausea, drowsiness, and exposure that may lead to a coma, which is especially possible with older residents. Within the lungs, the bacteria fills up the lungs, clogging one’s ability to breathe until they collapse all together and force fatality upon the contractant. Bacteria spread throughout the entire lines of communication within the nervous system causing paralysis within the body, it can spread to the tissues that separate our external appearance, leading to skin rashes,and they can spread to our reproductive organs, rendering us infertile.</p>

 <p class="goldy">As research, in the development and cures continue, we have developed antibiotics to treat tuberculosis, and a vaccine that prevents the disease all together, however, because of the development and overuse of antibiotics and vaccinations, we have accelerated the evolving variation of tuberculosis that is resistant to the drugs. These drug-resistant bacteria, are even harder to treat, and are slowly but surely trending in contractions and cases. In many cases the immunity to disease is divided into three levels, and with each level, the amount of resistance the bacteria's have to the antibiotics and vaccinations treatment becomes larger, stronger and harder to fight back. It has become so dangerous, to the point that being treated with an antibiotic or vaccination of the disease can actually enable and Empower to disease, spreading it quicker and making it even more fatal, to the point where saving the person from the disease becomes all but impossible. The only true solution to this issue, is to be more conservative of the use of antibiotics and vaccinations, we must also provide more healthy activities, and spread awareness and knowledge of the disease to all communities that are at risk to prevent the overuse of the medicine. We must ensure that we as individuals are not so reckless and our day-to-day lies at our more careful about the risk of the disease. Some things you as a human being can do to prevent tuberculosis, is to avoid contractions of immune diseases such as HIV, which can weaken your immune system and leave you vulnerable to active tuberculosis. You must also make active use of washing hands and avoid sick individuals that could potentially had the disease. This is especially crucial individuals that may have contracted a resistant variation of active tuberculosis which is harder to treat.</p>

 <p class="goldy">To conclude my thoughts, we as an organization are responsible for providing information awareness, and protection closest. Tuberculosis is an infectious disease that spreads from air-to-air contact. The disease affects the lungs when activated, and spreads to all of the parts of the body making a very serious and deadly disease in all aspects. Although vaccinations and antibiotics have been designed and made to combat the disease, are overuse of these tools have enabled the resistance of the disease through natural selection and evolution, at some further combat that we must ensure awareness, and Tasha and all individuals that are at risk of the movie so that we need the disease treating methods and medicines less and less. By involving ourselves, and exposing ourselves to these behaviors we put the entire world at risk, so it is important and it is our responsibility as human beings to stay safe healthy and active. By doing this we will win the fight against tuberculosis.
